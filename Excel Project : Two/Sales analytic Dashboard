ðŸ“Š Excel Data Analysis Project â€“ Sales analytic Dashboard
As part of my continuous learning and upskilling journey in Excel, I completed a Sales analytic Dashboard Project by following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial by Abhas A. on his channel Data Professionals. 

ðŸ”§ Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to create a professional and interactive Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. This hands-on exercise helped me strengthen my understanding of core Excel functionalities, formulas, and visualization techniques used in real-world data analysis scenarios. The project delivers a fully automated, dynamic excel dashboard that integrate data collection, cleaning, analysis and visualization. It is designed as self-sufficient tool, requiring no future intervention from data professional. Clint can immediately begin using the dashboard to make informed, data-driven decision effortlessly.   
The objective is to address the following key business questions posted by the clint: 
â€¢	Which product generate the highest revenue and profit, and what are their associated costs?
â€¢	What are the trends on financial metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit over time?
â€¢	How do order statuses (completed, pending, returned) evolve, and what patterns can we identify. 

ðŸ“Œ Key Skills Practiced:
â€¢	Data Cleaning 
o	Standardizing Format:  Ensure uniform date, time, and numeric formats for consistency. 
o	Validating Data: Apply checks for errors, such as valid emails and proper spelling.
o	Removing duplicates: Remove duplicate entry to maintain data integrity. 
o	Handling Missing Value: Fill gaps using imputation, interpolation or appropriate removal.
o	Correcting inconsistencies: Fix variation in spelling, capitalization, or data entry errors. 

â€¢	Data Processing:
o	Merging Tables:  Combine datasets using keys to create a unified view of the data.  
o	Creating Calculated Columns: Add new columns derived from formulas and logical operations. 
o	Applying VLOOKUP: Link related data across tables to enrich the dataset with relevant information. 
o	Filtering and Sorting: Organize data to focus on relevant subsets and insight.  

â€¢	Data Analysis

o	Descriptive Statistics:
âœ“ Perform a comprehensive statistical summary to uncover key patterns and trends in the dataset.
âœ“ Identify outliers and distributional properties to ensure data consistency and reliability before further analysis.
o	Hypothesis Testing Using t-Test:
Conduct a two-sample t-test to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between two groups or conditions based on the client's business question.

â€¢	Data Collection
o	Design Form:
Create the input form, lock non-input areas, and designate writable fields.
o	Set Up VBA:
Write a VBA macro to handle form submission and move data to the database.
o	Auto-Populate & Store Data:
Automatically calculate fields and store data in the database.
o	Confirm & Reset:
Show a confirmation pop-up and reset the form for new data entry.

â€¢	Dashboard
o	Create KPI in Pivot Table:
Design the pivot table to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).
o	Design Framework:
Plan the layout and structure of the dashboard on paper, then replicate it in Excel.
o	Create Charts:
Add the necessary charts to visualize the KPIs and data insights.
o	Add Slicers:
Insert slicers for interactive filtering of data within the dashboard.
o	Final Check:
Review the dashboard for accuracy, and functionality.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
â€¢	Data Cleaning: Fix errors, remove duplicates, and prepare datasets. 
â€¢	Data Processing: Organize and transform data efficiently. 
â€¢	Data Analysis: Perform calculations and gain insights.
â€¢	 Data Collection: Create a modern data entry form that stores data automatically.
